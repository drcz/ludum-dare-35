Make sure you hear the sounds, they are crucial to the experience!
As of flickering: no doubt it's annoying, but I just can't imagine a Flickering Torus that does not flicker... can you?

Sounds made with korg volca keys, and an improvised contact microphone.
Graphics made with pencil, marker and imageMagick.

Enjoy!
